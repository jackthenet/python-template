# Verification: user-roles-permissions

## Change Type: CROSS-CUTTING

- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Branch:** `crosscut/user-roles-permissions`
- **Worktree:** `../python-template_kopie-worktrees/crosscut/user-roles-permissions`

## Classification Rationale

The change is a **new shared capability** (a permissions/authorization system) that
intentionally spans two or more features:

- **usermanagement** — role model and role assignment (existing: `"admin"` / `"member"`
  roles, `set_role`, `LastAdminError` guard).
- **New shared permissions feature** — per-feature/action permission model and the
  backend permission-check capability that other features depend on.

It is not an ISSUE (no deviation from approved spec behavior), not a REFACTOR
(externally observable behavior is added), and not a DOCS/CHORE (behavior changes).
