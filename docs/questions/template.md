# Questions: <change-name>

One question file per change, created at **P.1 Frame** from this template and named `<change-name>.md`. It replaces the retired central `AI_Questions.md` (archived at `docs/questions/archive-AI_Questions.md`).

- **Change:** <change-name> (<type>)
- **TODO file:** `docs/todo/<change-name>.md`
- **Spec:** `docs/specs/<change-name>.md`  <!-- or n/a -->
- **Opened:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Status:** OPEN  <!-- OPEN | ALL ANSWERED -->
- **Answer rounds:** <n>

Every question that needs user input is recorded HERE — never in a central file. A step that needs input records **all** of its open questions in one batch and returns `BLOCKED-USER`; the orchestrator presents them (as few `ask_user_question` rounds as possible, <= 4 per round, most blocking first), records the answers here, marks each **ANSWERED** and **incorporated**, and relaunches the step **once** with the full answer set. The change is `WAITING` while its questions are unanswered — the orchestrator works on another change meanwhile, it does not idle.

### Entry format

```markdown

## Preparation questions (P.2)

## Late questions (Phases 2–6)

<questions discovered after the change entered the workflow; same entry format, Step field set to the step that found it>
